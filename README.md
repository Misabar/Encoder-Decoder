# Encoder-Decoder
 This is a small text encoder/decoder.

 After encoding, the text will be saved to a file called coded.txt and will also be saved to a file called ToDecode.txt so that you can   decode your encoded sentence instantly.
 You can then copy it from the file and use it as a secret message.

 For decoding, you can either paste a encoded message in the ToDecode.txt and save the file and then run the program
 or
 the sentence you had recently coded  will be taken automatically from the file and the decoded message will be shown

 For your convenience there are two types of encoders and decoders:1_2 type and 1_la type(If you encode in 1_2 type, then you must decode  in 1_2 type itself, same goes for 1_la type)

 If you want to write or send messages that you don't want others to understand, then this is the right program for you!
#Email sending
 To encode and send as email:
 just type in the message(uncoded message) in the Message.txt file , the recepient's email either during runtime(only one) or in the     Contacts.txt file(Multiple) and then run the program and select the 3rd option.
 Then just type in your email address* and password* and you're ready to go 

 *both will not be saved
